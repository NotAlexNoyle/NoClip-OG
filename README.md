*A Spigot plugin that allows you to phase through solid blocks like in Portal 2's console mode!*

![NoClip OG](https://github.com/NotAlexNoyle/NoClip-OG/blob/main/assets/example.png)

The most free (as in freedom) and full-featured plugin of it's kind. NoClip-OG will teleport the player to any safe location above them upon exiting NoClip mode, even if it's not the surface of the world.

It works by seamlessly blending together creative and spectator mode. The code is fully documented, and I am happy to answer any questions you have about it. Pull requests and issues are welcomed.

Supports LuckPerms, Java 17, and Gradle. Built against Purpur 1.18.2, though it may support other versions as well.

NoClip-OG and all other plugins in the "OG" suite are developed for [TrueOG](https://trueog.net), a 100% free and open source Minecraft Server. Need support? Join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/ma9pMYpBU6) and ask your question in #developer-chat.

Future Enhancements Planned:

- Switching to survival mode should disable NoClip and teleport the player to the nearest safe location above them

- The prefix tag and messages should be modifiable via a config.yml

- The plugin should be able to get turned on and off globally in-game or via the console

- The plugin should be able to get reloaded in-game or via the console

- When the server is halted, players who were inside blocks should be teleported to a safe location or kept in NoClip mode
